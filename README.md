# RoboChase

*Under Construction!*

Zap the robots before they catch you! A very simple 2D shooter inspired by the DOS game 'Robot Revenge'.

## TODO

 - Add scoring and window chome
 - Fix level generation to prevent robots and player spawning on blocks
 - Defeat & victory animations for either game outcome
 - Improve graphics and replace placeholders
 - Fix collision detection
 - Fix the way the objects are stored in the scene
